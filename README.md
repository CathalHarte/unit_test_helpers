Unit Test Helpers
=================

GTEST helpers, fff helpers, and OpenCV visualisation helpers (more of a debug helper that Unit test helper, but with some macros that make specific application to unit testing simpler to clean up afterward).

Manual installation of support libraries required ( by the logic that these are capability extensions to libraries which are already in use)
